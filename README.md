## Project Ideas

Participants are encouraged to work on projects that leverage Alfresco technologies.

**For people with a project idea**

For each project, you should consider addressing the following:

* The idea owner(s)
* A brief description
* Any prep work for the project, such as developer tools or skills participants should understand

We encourage you to keep your project idea short and provide any additional details in separate document or blog post within the Collaborate space. This may also allow you to coordinate with potential team members via the comments there without being mixed in with any discussions on this page.

**For people looking to join a project**

Please feel free to add your name to any project(s) you are interested in participating. Don't hesitate to add your name to multiple projects if you are considering multiple at this point. We encourage you to use this platform to contact the owner of an idea to discuss any details you are unsure about or even improve upon the idea.

Apart from any plans you make with the owner of an idea, you are not bound to actually participate in the project you indicated here. When you join the hack-a-thon on the day of the event you can check with other project teams and join a different project, if that turns out to be a better fit for you.

**For people looking for an idea**

If you're searching for ideas to kickstart your project, you've come to the right place. Below, you'll find inspiration drawn from past Hack-a-thon events, an overview of the latest features from Alfresco 7.x, and some exciting possibilities with Alfresco GenAI projects.

# Projects

## Community Platform

**Provide an OpenSearch search subsystem for Alfresco Community**

Idea owner: [Angel Borroy](https://github.com/aborroy)

Description: The aim of this project is to provide an OpenSearch search subsystem for Alfresco Community.

The main objective is to develop a new application that utilizes the existing [Repository SOLR endpoints](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-community-repo/tree/master/remote-api/src/main/resources/alfresco/templates/webscripts/org/alfresco/repository/solr) to fetch information from the Repository and update the OpenSearch index using a polling process similar to the one currently employed in the Solr search subsystem.

Components to be developed:

- OpenSearch Search Subsystem as extension for [alfresco-community-repo](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-community-repo/tree/master/repository/src/main/resources/alfresco/subsystems/Search)
  - Support for AFTS and CMIS search syntax

- An application that can be run as a *container* (a basic implementation available in [alfresco-neural-search](https://github.com/aborroy/alfresco-opensearch-neural-search/tree/main/alfresco-neural-search))
  - Indexing
    - Metadata ingestion
    - Content ingestion
    - Permissions (potentially added to each OpenSearch document to reduce complexity)
    - Paths (including cascade updating of Path properties)
  - Configuration
    - Model synchronizer

>> The implementation should be compatible with an out-of-the-box OpenSearch service, including basic authentication with TLS or mTLS communication modes.

## Content Services

**Develop Repository Administration Console UI for JavaScript Console**

Idea owner: [Axel Faust](https://github.com/AFaust) (note: multiple ideas - I may/can only work on one and anyone interested may take over ownership of this idea)

Description: The aim of this project is to develop a (basic) frontend for the JavaScript Console functionality of the [OOTBee Support Tools](https://github.com/OrderOfTheBee/ootbee-support-tools) addon in the Repository-tier Administration Console.

Background: In version 1.2.0.0 of the [OOTBee Support Tools](https://github.com/OrderOfTheBee/ootbee-support-tools) an "as-is" fork of the JavaScript Console addon was included with the module. Considering that the Alfresco Share UI has been deprecated for a while and Alfresco is working on an ADF-based Control Center, it would be ideal if the JavaScript Console functionality no longer required Share (or any additional UI) as its primary UI.

While it would be the goal to eventually have feature parity with the existing Share frontend, this hackathon project's focus would be more on a working "minimum viable product" state with a web-based code editor library of choice that can be extended after the hackathon event towards the eventual full functionality.

**Process pending pull request(s) for OOTBee Support Tools**

Idea owner: [Axel Faust](https://github.com/AFaust) (note: multiple ideas - I may/can only work on one and anyone interested may take over ownership of this idea)

Description: The aim of this project is to process any pending pull request(s) in the Order of the Bee Support Tools project. Especially a PR provided by Heiko Robert for the JavaScript Console warrants consideration and may need to some work to integrate with the latest state.

## Content Services Community AI Integrations

**Further work on the Alfresco AI Assistants**

Idea owner: [Domenico Sibilio](https://github.com/dsibilio)

Description: The aim of this initiative is to perform further work on the [Alfresco AI Assistants](https://github.com/AlfrescoLabs/alfresco-ai-assistants), improving the current implementation and trying out new potential features!

Background: The [Alfresco AI Assistants](https://github.com/AlfrescoLabs/alfresco-ai-assistants) repository contains a set of powerful AI assistants that help users and customers get the information they need or perform complex tasks, simply conveying each request via natural language. The project is entirely written in Python.

Some example features that could be worked on as part of this initiative _(we're open to ideas!)_:

**Alfredo:**
  * experiment with user-specific authentication rather than using a configurable service account
  * experiment with tool-chaining _(read: give the power to the AI to chain multiple tools in a row on its own rather than through orchestration)_
  * implement AI reliability features such as e.g.: jailbreaking detection
  * experiment with adding support for text-to-image models such as e.g.: Stable Diffusion

**Alfresco Docs Bot:**
  * implement a crawling mechanism to perform live-ingestion of the documentation rather than ingesting it from the filesystem
  * implement chat memory with resettable conversations
  * implement AI reliability features such as e.g.: jailbreaking detection

## Process Services

**Implement developer tooling to sync/deploy process, form, and app definitions with APS instance**

Idea owner: [Axel Faust](https://github.com/AFaust) (note: multiple ideas - I may/can only work on one and anyone interested may take over ownership of this idea)

Description: The aim of this project is to develop some developer tooling that helps to synchronise models in an APS runtime with models under version control.

Background: Not all projects in a Process Services context work with fully user-managed process, form, and app models. In quite a few use cases models may be provided by developers and may also be under source code version control. There currently does not exist tooling that helps developers work with version controlled models, automated deployment, and/or synchronisation with the runtime state of (local) dev instances. Exported app definitions in ZIP format do not lend themselves to be version controlled. Repeated import/export cycles result in changes to model IDs and versions, that can make it difficult to manually deal with references. Lastly, exported JSON models are unformatted, which also does not work well with text-based line-by-line diffing in version control.

At least two distinct use cases should be considered as very common and in need of support:

* (automated) deployment of (potentially updated) app definitions and models bundled with a JAR built from an extension project
* synchronisation of app definitions and models in an extension project with a Process Services runtime (dev) instance, compatible with common source code versioning practices

**Implement open source library of (extended) ACS integration tasks**

Idea owner: [Axel Faust](https://github.com/AFaust) (note: multiple ideas - I may/can only work on one and anyone interested may take over ownership of this idea)

Description: The aim of this project is to develop an open source / community-managed library of process tasks for the integration with ACS that extends to core set of capabilities included in APS.

Background: Process Services comes with basic ACS integration tasks used in storing content in ACS and changing metadata of such content, including utilities for the convenient definition of such integrations in the editor. In some use cases, the set of this functionality may be too limited. Simple tasks such as copying or moving content, changing permissions, creating relationships etc. are currently (AFAIK) not possible out-of-the-box.

## Content Services - Alfresco GenAI Semantic / Knowledge Graphs

**Further work on Alfresco GenAI Semantic project fork of Alfresco GenAI project**

Idea(s) owner: [Steve Reiner](https://github.com/stevereiner) 

Description: The fork of the [Alfresco GenAI](https://github.com/aborroy/alfresco-genai) project  into [Alfresco GenAI Semantic](https://github.com/stevereiner/alfresco-genai-semantic) project  adds entity linking of documents in alfresco to Wikidata and DBpedia. The [spaCy NLP python library](https://spacy.io/) along with spaCy projects are used for getting the entity links. 
Currently the 2 custom aspects have multivalue properties for the links, alfresco tags aren't used. Plan to
change to hierarchy of category tags so can search say category auto and get documents with entity links to Honda and Toyota, etc.
See [blog article on project] (https://integratedsemantics.org/2024/06/12/alfresco-genai-semantic-project/)

Performance could be improved by sending text renditions instead of pdf renditions to the python code. I could use help on this.

**Knowlege Graphs**

* Have entity links created in Neo4j and/or RDF datatabase like Ontotext GraphDB. Neo4j's rdflib-neo4j could be used for common schema.
* Have more a complete knowledge graph of a document created (also have relations) Bunch of projects like Neo4j's [NaLLM](https://github.com/neo4j/NaLLM) and
[Knowledge Graph Builder](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/llm-graph-builder) are out there. Most focus on doing this all with LLMs (with and with out a constraining schema).
Going to try with the entity links from spacy nlp and then have LLMs finish the job. 
* Be able to display the graph for one document or multiple documents from the ACA client. Keep the graphs updated with repository changes.
* GenAI natural language could be used to search such graphs (with SPARQL or cypher queries generated under the covers by GenAI).

## Content Services, Process Services: Python API

Idea(s) owner: not [Steve Reiner](https://github.com/stevereiner), just suggesting:

**Python API for Alfresco ACS**
Assume this would be a remote api on top of Alfresco Content Services REST API. Apache chemistry has a cmislib python client api. See Jeff Pott's blog [cmislib topic](https://ecmarchitect.com/categories/apache-chemistry/cmislib).
Note by [Axel Faust](https://github.com/AFaust): I have in the past started work on a [python client lib](https://github.com/Acosix/alfresco-python-client) for a customer who wanted to access Alfresco in a Chatbot client.

**Python API for Alfresco Process Services**
This would be good to have also if it doesn't exist.

## Content Services, Process Services: GraphQL, Content Services: GQL

Idea(s) owner: not [Steve Reiner](https://github.com/stevereiner), just suggesting:

**Further work on [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) api**
* GraphQL is more of style of doing apis than a very specific standard. 
* Some work was has been done:
* [GraphQL endpoint for Alfresco ACS](https://github.com/asauvez/alfresco-graphql)
* [Alfresco DevCon 2018: The Power fo GraphQL in Activiti Query API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKl7w5LN7v0)

**New work on GQL**
* Could Alfresco support the GQL query standard?
[GQLstandards.org](https://www.gqlstandards.org/home)
[GQL Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Query_Language)
[GQL Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/blog/cypher-gql-world/)
* GQL could be supported standalone or within GraphQL.
* In regards to GQL, see mult-model below.

## Multi-Model: Postgres + Apache AGE Graph Database Extension + Alfresco

Idea(s) owner: not [Steve Reiner](https://github.com/stevereiner), just suggesting:

* Idea is to have is to have the graph capabilities more tightly integrated for application development and querying purposes.

* Postgres + [Apache AGE](https://age.apache.org/) Graph Database Extension would be used with Alfresco Community or Alfresco Enterprise.

* Postgres versions: Alfresco supports Postgres versions 13 thru 15. The versions of Postgres supported by AGE are 11 thru 16. Note: Amazon Aurora supports many Postgres extensions but didn't see AGE.

* Commercial multi-model databases that support graphs like [Oracle, MSSQL, etc.](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/graph+dbms/all) could also be supported without AGE
with Alfresco

* Could graph types be used in alfresco aspects?

* Even more more extreme: could Alfreso folder and document content model be done in graph types? (May then not even need relational and could run on graph databases)

* How to query: AGE has openCyper GQL like support that can be used with extensions to Postgres SQL. How would you also query Alfresco?

* Note: vector support is being considered by Apache AGE: A proposal for applying PGvector to Apache AGE has been posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/age/issues/1121) 
  
* RQF and SPARQL could be suported:
Open source code from Neo4j [neosemantics](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neosemantics) server side java and/or [rdflib-neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/rdflib-neo4j) client side python could be adapted to work with Apache AGE + Postgres. With multi-model databases that support RDF like [Oracle, IBM DB2, Virtuoso etc.](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/rdf+store/all)
